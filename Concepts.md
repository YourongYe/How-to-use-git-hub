# Central version control:
It stores all the projects and versions together in the central server. 

# Advantage: 
One authority

# Disadvantage:
Network overheads  
Cannot get the files without internet. For example, you cannot edit the scripts on the airplane  

# Decentralised version control system:
It stores your version locally, on your own machine. Others have their versions on their own machines. There could be a central authority that you can update changes to. If you want to work with other people, it can be tricky.
